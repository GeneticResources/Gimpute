Description: Genotype imputation is essential for genome-wide association studies 
	(GWAS) to retrieve information of untyped variants and facilitate comparability 
	across studies. Based on widely used and freely available tools, 
	we have developed Gimpute, an automated processing and imputation pipeline 
	for genome-wide association data. Gimpute includes pro-cessing steps for 
	genotype liftOver, quality control, population outlier detection, 
	haplotype pre-phasing, imputation, post imputation, data management 
	and the extension to other existing pipeline.
